## A bit about this project 
I chose this Project because when I was working through BloomTech as a student. This is the first time everything started to come together for me and make sense. I was putting together a practical use for what I was learning. So this was my "AHA" moment. 

What I used: Vanilla JS | HTML | CSS

## Github User Cards

In this project we are going to be accessing the GitHub API and building a social card based on the data we get back. The goal is to create a component based on the data we get when we send a GET request to the GitHub API (requesting your own data at first). The CSS and the base HTML is already done for you, you simply need to create the component function and connect the pieces.
